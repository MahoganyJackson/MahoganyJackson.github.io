    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dobby relished his groinsaw's roar as he withdrew the flesh-choked blade from the astronaut's ruined skull. He turned to Harry, thrusting his bloody, retina-covered pelvis with elfin fervor.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"How does Ronnie Ron taste, master?"</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry spat out an eyeball. "Like some kid with eyes."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dobby ducked an astronaut's poison barbed fist, digging his groinsaw into the beast's abdomen and letting the spray of viscera wash over his elfin space armor. The skulls' eye sockets on his shoulders grew brilliant with an infernal cast and vomited a bolt of light through an astronaut; he was thrown back against the deathwall, his flesh boiling in another dimension.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry slapped Dobby, who giggled.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry reminded himself to kill himself later.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Master, look out!"</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dobby's groinsaw screamed as it flew off the armor, rocketing through the air like an early dream of mankind. It flew through three astronauts who dropped their hellspears as the saw cut a hole in the ground beneath them so they fell to hell forever.</span></p>

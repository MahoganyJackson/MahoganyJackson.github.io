    <p class="para3"><span class="span2">Chapter 3</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry slammed his book shut. It wasn't really a book, because the pages were made of lasers and the words were made of headless women making godless love to dragons made out of motorcycles, but it was still reading.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Gumbledorp, if you don't stop, we'll starve, and no one will be around to kill everyone in the universe if we get around to bringing everyone back to life after we killed them."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"I am no longer Scrumblegort."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">The ancient man dropped some of the planets he was juggling.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"The worlds have shifted. I am Dumblecop, of the Darkmeal."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">He flexed one of his legs, which was made of pistols, and kicked a planet in half.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Bugger your Darkmeal, faggart of a thousand suns."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dumblecop sniffed.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"And what of it? Is it a sin, should a man feel like faggarting a sun or a thousand? Why should the suns heave through the void, if not to be skewer't bypon ourn fagpoles?"</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry cast a glance at the book. Unsavory sounds emanated from a particularly damned chapter. He was hungry. He looked at a nearby cup. It had a faded brown film on the bottom. He thought about chumpits.</span></p>

    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Warning: Chapter 3 includes invented distortions of homphobic slurs and Chapter 6 includes the word "rape," but no actual rape.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">I was a much younger, less wordly person person when I wrote these stories. I felt that things like rape and homophobic slurs, while awful, could be warped into absurd caricatures that transcended their hurtful origins. While this may be true in other contexts, from other authors, I do not feel it is my place to do it. The experiences of those who have suffered from rape and homophobia are bad enough as it is without my story normalizing the language that makes them accepted. I could delete the stories, but that would not change their history and prevalence. I choose to let them remain as a testament to my prior ignorance.</span></p>

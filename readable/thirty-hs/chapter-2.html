    <p class="para3"><span class="span2">Chapter 2</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Now, Dobby."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dobby knelt before his master.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry withdrew his guitar, Fuckslayer, from a dimension where all screamed for naught.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Wrought from the silver heart of heaven's false promise, laced with vessels that pulsed with angel's menstrual blood, hewn from the horns of Satan's generals, it laughed as it was set loose, a laugh that only Harry could hear, but no one could share.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry swung the guitar through Dobby's chicken neck. He took the head of his fallen dwarfslave and tore open his stomach, stuffing the head inside. Harry vomited steam and summoned a great meteor from space to smash into Hogwarts and kill everyone there, for no reason at all. A vision then appeared. It was Dumbledore, entombed in his cursed mummy armor, calling Harry from his Moonbase which wasn't on a moon.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Harry, you must rock the fuck out."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry channeled his rage through Fuckslayer. The angel blood boiled as he summoned the great meteor, swathed with the blood of the tiny fucklings at Hogwarts, leapt onto it, and flew into space. He encased the entire meteor in a wreath of holy fuckfire and flew through Mercury, killing the fuck out of it. Then he sent Mercury's carcass into Venus, killing the fuck out of it and making every vagina in the galaxy explode, and inside every vagina a booby sang of mortal life's fleeting precipice.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Harry then did fly his meteor through space, punching astral vampires in half with his fists encased in fuckfire and throwing their ruined heads into the past where they bit cavemen on mars so that history changed and now there are vampire cavemen on mars. Harry received another vision from Frumblegore, who was having tea and chumpits with the president of Pangea.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"Care to have tea, Harry?"</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">"You know how I hate chumpits."</span></p>

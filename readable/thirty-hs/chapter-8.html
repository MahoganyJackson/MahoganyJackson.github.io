    <p class="para3"><span class="span2">Chapter 8</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Severus Snapplebottom began his life as a hand on which were perched each of the five first presidents of a country called America. The first two presidents, Geheb and Swonash, were turned into ashes by a passing wave of fast food regulation. Their ashes were consumed by children in various Wendy's establishments. Each plastic packet was a coffin for their memory, and no one knew their name, even though they were listed on the ingredient list. These children became soldiers in wars fought for control of who had all the bullets. Whoever shot the most bullets the fastest won.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">The third president, Wahooley, went to a country that was nothing but a desert with half buried turkeys. Sometimes turkey butts were above the sand, sometimes a leg, or a head. Wahooley tripped and fell into a turkey head, where he was eaten and ordained as a rabbi. He was sent to trim the beards of 157 toads, whose beards were absorbing the water that was used for the next year's crop of shovels. Without these shovels, the peasants would be unable to shovel the ashes of their children from the bullet wars. Wahooley took these beards and formed a lasso. This lasso was a ropey wonder. He used it to tear off his penis and write the 13 commandments of America upon a passing eagle, in cock's blood:</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">1: You are stupid.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">2: Baby, someone cut off my dick and wrote an America with it.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">3: If a whale tries to sell you a pumpkin, don't.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">4: Your head is an artifice. Throw it away, but don't let anyone see you do it or you'll be kicked out of school.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">5: Always collect a ghost's shadow if it leaves one behind. It will be worth something someday.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">6: Starbucks napkins are hereby the new currency, but only after they are smeared upon the corpse of a mule. The exchange rate will be 13 mules to one napkin.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">7: Taxi cabs will be used to build a pyramid with 290 sides. It will be the white house, and the president will live there for 17 years at a time, while you eat your children's ashes on a bun.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">8: On Father's day, you will enter an invisible box and be plunged into the ocean. There, you will enter an undersea candy store, but you will never have enough Starbucks napkins to get what you want.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">9: It is all spam, all of it. Check the box and delete it. Now delete yourself, for you are spam.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">10: All clocks will be inscribed with the entirety of the alphabet to save time. This is the alphabet:</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">6+7=A</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">14*12=B</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">16 - {eleventy two}= President Wahooley</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">And so on, until you reach the period, which is the end of the alphabet.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">11: All previous constitutions were writ by false writers, whose passing eagles were inferior and whose cocks had fewer things in them. Accept only the American cockstitution.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">12: Spend your adolescence as a duck, waddling in a circle, until you become an egg full of dust.</span></p>
    <p class="para4"><span class="span3">13: All time is a knotted ball. You can hide it anywhere in your body, and it is still time.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">President number four, whose name was not a name, but a multitude of hot dogs in the shape of swastikas, decided that he would create the Gilded Age. This was a time in which every edge was embossed with a golden trim, like a wedding cake invented by Thomas Edison. All the women wore bonnets made of butter, and were picked up by their feet and spread on toast in the summer. It was all for naught, because this was not the toast of the righteous. It was a feeble toast, one which withered with the coming of the sun. Not even the crows would touch it, preferring the taste of mouldering poop water. But the crows were put in dresses and sold to the highest bidder, where they underwent liposuction.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">President five disliked the conservative leanings of his brothers, so he became an infinite two-dimensional grid of pink and green squares. Each square had a vagina upon it. These vaginas each emitted a spear of light, upon which was skewered an endless succession of planets. Each carried a culture dedicated to a single sex act. The further down the skewer the planet was, the more orifices possessed by its denizens, and the more gymnastic their sexual culture. The worlds...</span></p>

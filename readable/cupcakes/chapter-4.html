    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Silver Spoon suddenly woke up. She was on her back and couldn’t move. She couldn’t see. Where was she? Freaking out, she was just about to scream when the pony from the bakery appeared in front of her.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“HI!” she giggled</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Where am I? ... what’s going on”? The frightened little foal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Oh, well, you see, your number came up and I gotta make cupcakes.” Pinkie explained.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“W… wha… what does that mean? What are you talking about”?</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Oh, nothing. I wouldn’t worry it if I was you. It’ll be over soon.” She approached the girl, scalpel at the ready when a small voice called out from behind.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Miss Pinkie, what do you think you are doing”?</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">She paused and turned to look at Apple Bloom. The yellow baby pony walked up to her with an angry look on her face. Silver Spoon started to feel relived.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Ah can’t believe you're doin' this.” She pouted. ”you said this one was gonna be mine."</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Pinkie apologized. “Oops, sorry about that, guess it got forgot. Here you go.” She handed the blade over.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Apple Bloom climbed on the table and stood over her prey. Silver Spoon tried to struggle. She stared in fear at Apple Bloom and her apron. The pink apron with a shiny tiara on it. Silver Spoon started to cry.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Apple Bloom grinned and opened her mouth “Hey, Silver Spoon, guess who gonna be a blank flank”?</span></p>

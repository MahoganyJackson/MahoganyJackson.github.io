    <p class="para3"><span class="span2">Chapter 2</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">When Dash regained conciseness, she found herself in a dark room. She tried to shake her head but found that the taut leather strap kept it firmly in place. She struggled to move, but the braces around her chest and limbs glued her to a rack formed from a series of sturdy planks, which spread her legs wide apart. Dash's wings were the only part of her not tied town, and they fluttered frantically while she struggled to escape. As she writhed, Pinkie jumped into her line of sight.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Goodie, you’re awake. Now we can get started.” She gleefully stated. She was pushing a cart covered with a cloth.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Pinkie, what’s going on? I can’t move!” Dash said in a worry.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Well, duh, you’re tied down.” Pinkie chided “That’s why you can’t move. I didn’t think you needed to told that.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“But why? What’s happening? I thought you said I was going to help make cupcakes.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“You are helping. You see. I ran out of the special ingredient and I need you to get more.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Special ingredient”? Dash was now breathing heavily and starting to panic. “What special ingredient”?</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Pinkie giggled and responded “You, silly.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash’s eyes widen, her face contorted in fear. Then she started to laugh ”Woo, really got me there, Pinkie pie. I mean, tricking me in to thinking I’m gonna get made to a cupcake. I gotta tell you, this the best prank yet. You win, you’re the best.“</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Pinkie giggled even more. “Aw, thanks Dash. But I haven’t done pranks today, so I can’t accept your praise.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash was struggling again. “Pinkie, come on, this isn’t funny.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Then why were you laughing”? Pinkie grabbed the cloth and whipped it off the cart. The top of the tray contained various sharp medical tools and knives carefully organized and ready. There was a medicine bag and several other objects next to them.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash was now in full panic mode. She was starting to hyperventilate. Her mind was racing and she tried to reason with the pink pony. “You can’t do this Pinkie! I’m your friend!”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“I know you are and that’s why I’m so happy it’s that I’ve got you here. We get to share your last moments together, just you and me.” She was skipping again.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“But, the other ponies will wonder where I am. When the clouds pile up, they’ll come looking for me and then you’ll get found out.” Dash was desperate.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Oh, Dash” Pinkie said “don‘t worry, there are plenty of pegasus to take care of a few clouds. And besides, no will find out. I mean, how long do you think I’ve been doing this?” And with that the lights suddenly came to life and showcased the rest the room.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Oh god, no” Dash reeled in horror at the image presented to her. The room was decorated with a typical but twisted Pinkie Pie flair. Colorful streamers of dried entrails danced around the ceiling, brightly painted skulls of all sizes were stuck on the walls, and organs done up in pastels filled with helium tied to the backs of chairs. The tables and chairs were made of bones and flesh of past ponies. Dash cringed at the center piece on the table nearest to her. The heads of four foals, their eyes closed like they were sleeping, wearing party hats made from their own skin. She recognized one of them as Apple Bloom’s classmate. Her eyes darted back and forth and then gazed up at the patchwork banner hanging from the rafters. Made from several pony hides, the words “Life is a party” were scrawled in red.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash’s attention was stolen by a party horn unfurling and tickling her nose. She saw Pinkie Pie standing in front of her. The party pony was wearing a dress quilted from cutie marks. On her back fluttered six pegasus wings, all different colors. As she skipped in excitement, her necklace of unicorn horns loudly clacked together.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Like it”? She asked “I made it myself.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash pleaded. “Pinkie please, I’m sorry if I did anything to you. I didn’t mean it. Please let me go. I promise I won’t tell anybody.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Oh Dash, you didn’t do anything. It’s just that your number came up and, well, I don’t make rules. We can’t turn back now.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Rainbow Dash was tearing up. How could this be happening?</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Aww don’t be sad Dash” Pinkie said “Look this’ll cheer you up. I brought you a friend.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Out of seemingly nowhere, Pinkie displayed a blue and yellow painted skull. It was about pony sized, but it had a very defining feature: a beak.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash was freaking out. “Is…is that…is…that?”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Hey, Dash lets hang together. These ponies are lame-os. Dweebs dweebs dweebs.” Pinkie mimicked. “I caught her right before she left town. Remember when I left the party for about twenty minutes? That wasn’t enough time to play with her of course, I had to wait till after the party to do that. But boy am I glad I did. It was worth for the flavor alone. Griffons taste like two animals at once, it’s amazing. I know she didn’t have number like everyone else in Ponville, but when was I gonna get another chance to try a griffon. I hindsight, I probably should have asked where she came from so I can get more, but I forgot. I’ll tell you what though, she was quite the fighter. Lasted a long time, which was fun for me, I got chance to play with somebody other than a pony and try new things. It’s too bad she had such a potty mouth. She said so much bad stuff, I had to take her tongue out. You know, bad language makes for bad feelings, Dash.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Dash didn’t have anything to say. She just sobbed and writhed.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Well” Pinkie said, putting the skull down” that’s enough reminiscing, it’s time to begin.” She picked up a scalpel and walked over to Dash’s right flank. Without any flair, she placed the blade an inch above her cutie mark and started a circular cut around it. Her lungs working overtime, Dash shouted in pain and tried desperately to pull away. But the braces held her still. Finishing the incision, Pinkie grabbed the curved skinning knife from the tray. She worked it under the skin and sliced the hide away from the muscle. Dash ground her teeth as she tearfully watched as her flesh came off. Pinkie then moved to the other side and completed the other flank. Once she was done, Pinkie held up both cutie marks in front of her friend and started waving them like pompoms. Dash just whimpered. Her thighs burned.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Placing the skin down, Pinkie selected the large butcher knife and walked behind Rainbow Dash.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Hope you don’t mind, I think I’m gonna wing it now. “ Pinkie laughed. She grabbed the left one and played with it for a second. Then, stretching the wing out, she brought the blade down at the base. Instantly, Dash screamed and thrashed her appendage. The movement threw off Pinkie Pies aim. She tried to hit the mark again but missed wide and put a huge slice in Rainbow’s back.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Dash, you gotta stay still or I’ll keep missing.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">She took another whack and hit the target. She swung again and again, blood spraying into the air, but realized she wasn’t getting anywhere. The blade just wasn’t going through the bone.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Hmm, I guess I forgot to sharpen it. I’ll try something else.” She stated as she tossed the knife over her shoulder; the blade embedding itself in the table.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">The crying Rainbow Dash heard the sound of a metal box opening and closing.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Got it! Say Dash, why do they call it a hack saw? It doesn’t hack; hacking is what I was doing with the knife. This is a saw. I don’t get it.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Pinkie placed the tool over the last attempt. It effortlessly sailed through the bone and skin. The painful feeling of the teeth grinding biting into her made Dash want to vomit. She watched helplessly as her wing flew over her head and land with a fluff on the table. Pinkie moved the next and started sawing. Dash didn’t struggle this time; she’d given up trying to fight and just cried. Then the sawing abruptly paused. Pinkie was only half way done, the wing hanging off by only a sliver.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Hey Dash” she piped up “think fast”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Suddenly, she yanked the wing as hard as sure could. The bone snapped but the skin held tight. The pull ripped a long strip flesh down Dash’s back to her rump. The unexpected trauma caused her body seize. She felt the warm release between legs as her pelvis tensed up. Dash’s loud, unending melody of pain filled the room. Unable to catch her breath, she blacked out.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">She awoke with a gasp. The stench of her urine filled her mucus caked nostrils. She saw a very pouty Pinkie Pie removing the adrenaline needle from her chest. Stomping her hooves, the frustrated Pinkie lashed out.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“Didn’t anybody teach you any manners? It’s very rude to fall asleep when somebody invites you over to spend time with them. How would like if I came over to your house and went to sleep. “Oh I’m sorry Dash, you’re boring, I think I’ll take a nap.” You think I like always doing this by myself. I told you how excited I got when I found you were next. I was excited to have to a friend be here with me while I worked. But NOOOOO! You’ve got to be inconsiderate. You know, I thought you were tough, I thought you could handle anything. I’ve had foals stand up better than you. Do I have to baby you? Huh? Is that how you want me to remember you, as a baby?”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">She stopped to catch her breath. Dash blinked and softly cried. Her back was on fire.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Pinkie then popped something red into her mouth and began to chew. She noticed Dash was staring at her.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“What?” she asked. “Oh this?” Holding up another piece. “Well, while YOU were asleep, I got a little impatient and helped myself sample. I got it from your leg, you’re not bad. Wanna try some”?</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Without waiting for a response, she shoved the strip of meat into the revolted Rainbow Dash’s mouth. She immediately spit it out. Pinkie picked up. “if you didn’t want it, you could have said no.” She then ate the discarded snotty morsel. “It’s not like you haven’t had it before.”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">Swallowing, she turned her attention to the small can on the tray. She removed the lid, revealing that it was filled with burning coals. Sitting on top of the fire were several large nails. Dash began to panic again. Pinkie picked up the can and walked over to Dash’s left. Carefully picking up a nail and grabbing a hammer, she positioned the spike at the seam between her leg and her hoof.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“No! Pinkie NO!” Dash screamed. “NO! NO!”</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">The hammer came down and the nail punctured under her skin. The white hot burning was too much. Dash pulled and thrashed at the brace, her skin rubbed and tore. Pinkie tried to line up another one, but couldn’t find her aim. She let out a frustrated grunt. When she pulled the hammer back to take a wild swing, Dash burst out crying and begging.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span1">“PLEASE STOP! PLEASE, PLEASE STOP!”</span></p>
